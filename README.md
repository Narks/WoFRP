This is a roleplaying map for WarCraft III The Frozen Throne that I never released. Please read map/LICENSE.txt before you do stuff with this. TL;DR you have to release any derivative work under the same license and provide an open source (unprotected) version of the map.

You'll need NewGen World Editor to open the map, and the Zinc preprocessor language to compile it (I think you might also need the latest VJass? Or ObjectMerger?).

There's also some GMSI scripts that I've added to the repo which I used to do stuff like generate object data.

If you have any issues, questions, or just want to chat, send me an email at praetor.narks@gmail.com with WoFRP in the subject.

Cheers,
Narks
